# required for the use of XmHTML.  The opening three conditions, if true, will
# bypass all XmHTML config operations; that is to say, if any of these
# conditions is true, we call with_xmhtml "no", and that's the end of the

# necessary, but we'll be conservative here).  We also send HAVE_XmHTML
# to config.h and the cache file.

# will find them by itself).  We've already eliminated the possibility of
# "none", so anything other than "" will definitely be a path.
