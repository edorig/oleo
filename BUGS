Build 
the mktime test in configure fails miserably 
the configure script generates a buggy texi2html perl script. 
SciPlot is not found by configure


Running Oleo
=============


Buggy Internationalization/Localization
----------------------------------------

When using a non-C locale where the decimal separator is the
comma ',' and not the decimal point '.' 
1) Graphs do not work whether with Plotutils or SciPlot 
After defining a graph, oleo crashes. 
2) Saving to a file leaves some lines 
Gr000,00000
...
Gr110,00000
in the .oleo file that will crash oleo when loading it. 
The solution is to replace Grnn0,000 with Grnn0.000 to obtain
a valid .oleo file 
3) When entering constants such as 1.6e-19, they are first transformed 
to 1,6e-19 then Oleo complains of a parse error. 
4) Postscript printing fails because coordinates are not written in the 
form Postscript printers/interpreters expect 

Workaround around all these bugs: start oleo with  LANG=C /path/oleo

A fix for bug 2) using setlocale(3) has been found in the current version.

printing
--------
See above for non-C locale.
Printing to file in ps format results in lines overwritten on each other. Editing the PS file, and doubling the ordinates shift produces a legible file. The part of postscript.c that calculate line heights contains an error. 
I have doubled the line height in postscript.c and now lines are not overwritten. Don't try to print more than 96 lines.

Printing UTF-8 or ISO8859-1 characters produces garbage.
Printing in text format causes a coredump. surprising as prtext.c does nothing.
GDB backtrace is

0x00005555555bdc68 in print_region_cmd (print=0x7fffffffd5b8, 
    fp=0x55555592c8a0) at print.c:352
#2  0x00005555555b3dad in ReallyPrintCB (w=<optimized out>, 
    client=<optimized out>, call=<optimized out>) at io-motif.c:1973

a message AfmFontWidth:failed is visible.

Format selection for files
--------------------------
Choosing sc,sylk,dbf format in "Save As" or "Open" menu causes a crash.
