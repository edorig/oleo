Build 
the mktime test in configure fails miserably 
the configure script generates a buggy texi2html perl script. 
SciPlot is not found by configure

Running Oleo
When using a non-C locale where the decimal separator is the
comma ',' and not the decimal point '.' 
1) Graphs do not work whether with Plotutils or SciPlot 
After defining a graph, oleo crashes. 
2) Saving to a file leaves some lines 
Gr000,00000
...
Gr110,00000
in the .oleo file that will crash oleo when loading it. 
The solution is to replace Grnn0,000 with Grnn0.000 to obtain
a valid .oleo file 

Workaround around these 2 bugs: start oleo with  LANG=C /path/oleo
