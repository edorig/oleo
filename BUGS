Build 
the mktime test in configure fails miserably 
the configure script generates a buggy texi2html perl script. 
SciPlot is not found by configure


Running Oleo
When using a non-C locale where the decimal separator is the
comma ',' and not the decimal point '.' 
1) Graphs do not work whether with Plotutils or SciPlot 
After defining a graph, oleo crashes. 
2) Saving to a file leaves some lines 
Gr000,00000
...
Gr110,00000
in the .oleo file that will crash oleo when loading it. 
The solution is to replace Grnn0,000 with Grnn0.000 to obtain
a valid .oleo file 
3) When entering constants such as 1.6e-19, they are first transformed 
to 1,6e-19 then Oleo complains of a parse error. 

Workaround around these 3 bugs: start oleo with  LANG=C /path/oleo

A fix for bug 2) using setlocale(3) has been found in the current version.

Printing to file in ps format results in lines overwritten on each other. 
Printing in text format causes a coredump

Choosing sc,sylk,dbf format in "Save As" or "Open" menu causes a crash.
