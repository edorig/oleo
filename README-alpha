Welcome to the Oleo Alpha tree !

Alpha releases are stable (don't crash), but incomplete.

This means that anyone who is capable of compiling GNU sources is
very welcome to grab the latest and work with it : it *should* work.

Known problems with this code are outlined in the files README, FAQ
and TODO.

If you are GNU friendly, you can check out this repository from its home at
/gd/gnu/cvsroot.  Otherwise, you will find new releases under

	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/oleo/

Finally, you're very welcome to contact us with questions, more TODO's,
or even "hey it works for me !" notes.

We're at bug-oleo@gnu.org .

Have fun,

The Maintainers
